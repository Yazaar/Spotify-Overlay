<h3>Setup guide (cloud edition, new version)</h3>
This is the URL for the overlay, open it up as a browser source if your software includes interact. Use the interact function by rightclicking on your browser source to login to your spotify account which you would like to track. I would recommend to drag the browser source out of the streams view while typing in your cridentials. You may exit the interact function when the login process is completed.<br>
I would recommend to use the dimensions 400 width and 100 height, but feel free to increase it while signing in to spotify (one time only)

<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
This URL can be used for the ones who does not have a software which includes interact, open it up in your standard browser. Login to your spotify account which you would like to track and wait to get redirected. A URL should pop up on your browser, copy it and paste it into your browser source. Wait for the page to load, then swap to the regular link found above (to hide your cridentials for safety reasons).

Choose the width and height of the browser source to your liking.<br>
Higher = Slower moving text<br>
Wider = more text displayed at once
